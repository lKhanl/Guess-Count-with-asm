# Guess-Count-with-asm

Objective(s) = Become familiar with using I/O devices and Emulation Kit.
Work = Write an assembly program which is able to play a number guess game. You must do all your work in an infinite loop. 
1. First you must get a number between 0-9 from user via emulator screen. If the input key is not a number then program must ask a number again (This process does not increase the total guess count).
2. Then the program must create a random number between 0-9 and display the numbers on Seven Segment Display Output as (U for User and C for Computer). 
3. At each guess (iteration), the program must print the number of correct guesses and total guesses on ASCII LCD Output (Guess counts are infinite, so the program must also be able print any number).
